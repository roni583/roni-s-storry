Hello,

My name is ekRoni. It is a shortened form of my full name, Ebrahim Khalil Roni.
This short name was created by me in 2022, And I used it after that.

Behind the scenes, this name suddenly came to my mind, and that’s when I decided to create it.
But when I open Facebook and use this email, the name that appears is ekRoni (Ek Roni) instead of the input I provided.
And then all of my social site use this name. but interesting matter is that i want to show e.k but not approve e.k in facebook so need to use ekRoni. so at the end it's very useful for me


											***The End***
